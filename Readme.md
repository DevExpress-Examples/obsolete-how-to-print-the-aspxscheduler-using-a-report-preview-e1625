â›” DEPRECATED. This example demonstrates how to use `ASPxDocumentViewer` to print `ASPxScheduler` control data. Starting with v23.1, the `ASPxDocumentViewer` class became obsolete. We recommend that you use the [ASPxWebDocumentViewer](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/DevExpress.XtraReports.Web.ASPxWebDocumentViewer) class instead. Refer to the following breaking change ticket for more information: 

* [The ASPxDocumentViewer and ReportViewer classes are obsolete as of v23.1 (updated on May 31, 2023)](https://supportcenter.devexpress.com/ticket/details/bc4904/the-aspxdocumentviewer-and-reportviewer-classes-became-obsolete-updated-on-may-31-2023).

The current repository will not be updated in the future.
