â›” DEPRECATED. This example demonstrates how to use `ASPxDocumentViewer` to print `ASPxScheduler` control data. Starting with v23.1, the `ASPxDocumentViewer` class became obsolete. We recommend that you use the [ASPxWebDocumentViewer](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/DevExpress.XtraReports.Web.ASPxWebDocumentViewer) class instead. Refer to the following breaking change ticket for more information:
